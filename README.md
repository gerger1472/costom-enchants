CustomEnchants - Complete Project

This archive contains a Fabric 1.21.1 mod project assembled from your uploaded src and
added registry, handlers, recipes, and a GitHub Actions workflow.

How to use:
1. Upload the extracted project to a GitHub repository named 'main' branch.
2. GitHub Actions will automatically run the workflow and build the mod.
3. Download the artifact (.jar) from the Actions tab.

If you want, I can now try to run the build here and upload the .jar for you.
